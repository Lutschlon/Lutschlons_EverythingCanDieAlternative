# EverythingCanDieAlternative 1.1.1

This mod aims to make every enemy in the game killable with configurable hp. It aims to work with any modded weapon and any modded enemy.
- You can of course also leave enemies immortal in the config to hit the right balance.
An alternative version of the EverythingCanDie mod from TheFluff as it did not work for me with a few modded enemies.

- I recommend using this mod with something like SellBodiesFixed as it handles the despawning of modded enemies' corpses. My mod does not deal with it.

<details><summary> Differences from Original Mod</summary>
- No separate shotgun/melee weapon settings
<br>- No Explosion Effects: Enemies simply die without explosion effects</details>

## Configuration
Start the game and host a lobby, then close the game and check out the configuration file in Thunderstore.
For each enemy, you can configure:
- `.Unimmortal` - Toggle if the enemy can be damaged (true/false) - Default is every enemy is killable
- `.Health` - Set the enemy's health value, default is often 3 or 0(1) for modded enemies that are not meant to be killed
  - For reference: the shovel deals 1 damage, the vanilla shotgun either 2/6/10 based on distance, modded weapons work as well with their own stats
 
<br>Everyone needs to have this mod installed for it to work
<details><summary>The config from the host is the only one that matters</summary> If everything is working properly</details>

## Known Issues
- Hitting a Forest Giant or Old Bird with the cruiser does not kill them. I will test this further and work on a fix.
